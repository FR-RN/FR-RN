**RRPR 2024 : Fifth Workshop on Reproducible Research in Pattern Recognition (satellite event of ICPR 2024), Dec. 2024 Kolkata (India).**

RRPR 2024 is intended as both a short participative course on the Reproducible Research (RR) aspects and also as a practical workshop on how to actually perform RR. Another key goal is to further advance the scientific aspects of reproducibility in pattern recognition research.
