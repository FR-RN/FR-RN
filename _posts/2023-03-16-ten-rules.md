Conducting a replication study is a valuable way for undergraduate students to learn about the scientific process and gain research experience. By promoting the evaluation of existing studies to confirm their reliability, replications play a unique, though often underappreciated, role in the scientific enterprise. Involving students early in this process can help make replication mainstream among the new generation of scientists. Beyond their benefit to science, replications also provide an invaluable learning ground for students, from encouraging the development of critical thinking to emphasizing the importance of details and honing research skills. In this piece, we outline 10 simple rules for designing and conducting undergraduate replication projects, from conceptualization to implementation and dissemination. We hope that these guidelines can help educators provide students with a meaningful and constructive pedagogical experience, without compromising the scientific value of the replication project, therefore ensuring robust, valuable contributions to our understanding of the world.
