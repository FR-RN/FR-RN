This [3-day symposium](https://nanobubbles.hypotheses.org/2139) is aimed at stimulating informal discussions on replications and unresolved questions about nanoparticles inside cells. We will combine talks of scientists who have engaged in research in nanobiology namely on nanoparticle entry into the cell (described below), with talks by researchers who have studied replications from a historical, philosophical, sociological, or anthropological perspective. Our goal is to create a space for an interdisciplinary exchange about replications of results whose credibility has been questioned.
