The Institute for Replication has conceived the Replication Games as one-day events where researchers collaborate to replicate studies from high-ranking journals (see the [dedicated page](https://i4replication.org/blog%20Games.html)). Each year, numerous Replication Games take place worldwide.

In fall 2025, the French Reproducibility Network will co-organize a replication game in Paris on October 3rd.

Further details are available on the dedicated [Institute for Replication page](https://i4replication.org/games.html).
