Computational reproducibility is a simple premise in theory, but
is difficult to achieve in practice. Building upon past efforts
and proposals to maximize reproducibility and rigor in
bioinformatics, we present a framework called the five pillars of
reproducible computational research. These include (1) literate
programming, (2) code version control and sharing, (3) compute
environment control,
(4) persistent data sharing and (5) documentation. These practices
will ensure that computational research work can be reproduced
quickly and easily, long into the future. This guide is designed
for bioinformatics data analysts and bioinformaticians in
training, but should be relevant to other domains of study.
