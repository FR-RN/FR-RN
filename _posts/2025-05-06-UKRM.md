Le 6 Mai 2025, Etienne Roesh a animé un wébianire de présentation du réseau de reproductibilité anglais :

Titre :
“The UK Reproducibility Network: A Grassroots Initiative to Foster Open Research”

*Résumé : The UK Reproducibility Network is a grassroot movement that stemmed from the strong desire to improve the quality of research in the UK. Since 2018, we have grown substantially, and now represent 80 research-intensive universities and research institutes across the UK. We are a network of local networks, and function at several levels, comprising local communities of researchers and research support staff, as well as institutional leads who have the backing of University management. We have been fortunate to receive substantial funding to promote and consolidate open research practices, which we are using towards several projects leveraging our large network of volunteers. In this talk, I will present the UKRN, its history, our structure, current projects and ways of working.*
