The reproducibility crisis has highlighted the importance of improving the way bioinformatics data analyses are implemented, executed, and shared. To address this, various tools such as content versioning systems, workflow management systems, and software environment management systems have been developed. While these tools are becoming more widely used, there is still much work to be done to increase their adoption. The most effective way to ensure reproducibility becomes a standard part of most bioinformatics data analysis projects is to integrate it into the curriculum of bioinformatics Master’s programs.
