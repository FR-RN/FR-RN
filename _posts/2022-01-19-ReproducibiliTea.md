The Bordeaux Neurocampus Graduate Program brings for 2022 a new activity to the Bordeaux Neurocampus community, the **[ReproducibiliTea Open Science Journal Club](https://neurocampus-graduateprogram.u-bordeaux.fr/Training-activities/ReproducibiliTea-Open-Science-Journal-Club)**. ReproducibiliTea consists in a cycle of monthly meetings in which students and young researchers can join to discuss various topics related to Open Science around a warm cup of tea and (why not?) delicious cookies (as soon as the pandemic situation allows gatherings again).
