This study reports an independent replication of the findings presented by Smaldino and McElreath (2016), “The natural selection of bad science”. The replication was successful with one exception. We find that selection acting on scientist’s propensity for replication frequency caused a brief period of exuberant replication not observed in the original paper due to a coding error. This difference does not, however, change the authors’ original conclusions. We call for more replication studies for simulations as unique contributions to scientific quality assurance.
