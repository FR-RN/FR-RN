A Student’s Guide to Open Science explores the so-called “replication crisis” in psychology (the inherent difficulties in reproducing research results to test the robustness of findings) while delving into the ways Open Science can address the crisis by transforming research practice.

Students will develop a fundamental understanding of the drivers and origins of the crisis and learn how Open Science practices can enhance research transparency, replication, and reproducibility.

With a handy, digestible guide for students and researchers alike on how to implement Open Science practices within their own workflow, as well as pedagogic teaching and learning activities that can be re-used by educators, Pennington’s new book is an essential guide to navigating the replication crisis.

Key features of this book include:

- Case studies of classic psychological studies undergoing replication. 
- Test yourself activities to reinforce learning of key concepts, including an open science crossword!
- Top tips boxes for open science practices including preregistration, Registered Reports, and open materials, code, and data. 
- Useful illustrations to aid understanding and facilitate revision.

New concepts and practices can often feel overwhelming, but this book aims to help students to pick what they want from the Open Science buffet and encourages them to keep returning to the table to fill up their plates again and again. Remember, we are all students of open science and will be for many years to come!

Charlotte Pennington is a Lecturer in Psychology at Aston University, UK and a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. She is an expert in open science and advocates for the teaching of this within higher education pedagogy.
