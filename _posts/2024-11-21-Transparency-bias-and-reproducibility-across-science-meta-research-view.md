*Transparency, bias, and reproducibility across science: a meta-research view*
John P.A. Ioannidis

It is a great honor to deliver the AAP Presidential Address. Let me start with disclosures. My main conflict of interest is
that I try to be a scientist. This means I am probably biased and often wrong, but hopefully not totally resistant to the
possibility of getting corrected. Let me also make some preemptive comments. First and foremost, science is the best
thing that can happen to humans, and research should be supported with heightened commitments. You have probably
heard this too many times, but it is worth repeating. However, most research done to date has used nonreproducible,
nontransparent, and suboptimal research practices. Science is becoming more massive and more complex. Scientific
publications (about 200 million already, with 7 million more added each year) are mostly advertisements (“trust me, this
research was done”); raw data and experimental materials and algorithms are not usually shared. Moreover, our reward
systems in academia and science are aligned with nonreproducible, nontransparent, and suboptimal research practices.
Can we do better? Even though we all use the scientific method, maps of science may visualize many thousands of
clusters representing different scientific disciplines (1). The research practices in these many disciplines vary substantially
in both expectations and implementation. However, some features are all too common. Notably, the quest for significance
is almost ubiquitous. Significance takes many [...]
