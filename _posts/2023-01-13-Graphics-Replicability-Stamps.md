The [Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative (GRSI)](http://www.replicabilitystamp.org/) is an independent group of volunteers who help the community by enabling sharing of code and data as a community resource for non-commercial use. The volunteers check the submitted code and certify its replicability, awarding a replicability stamp, which is an additional recognition for authors of accepted papers who are willing to provide a complete implementation of their algorithm, to replicate the results presented in their paper. The replicability stamp is not meant to be a measure of the scientiﬁc quality of the paper or of the usefulness of presented algorithms. Rather, it is meant to be an endorsement of the replicability of the results presented in the paper and the recognition of the service provided to the community by releasing the code. Submissions for the replicability stamp will be considered only *after* the paper has been fully accepted. Submissions that are awarded the replicability stamp will receive additional exposure by being listed on this website. The purpose of this stamp is to promote reproducibility of research results and to allow scientists and practitioners to immediately beneﬁt from state-of-the-art research results, without spending months re-implementing the proposed algorithms and trying to ﬁnd the right parameter values. We also hope that it will indirectly foster scientiﬁc progress, since it will allow researchers to reliably compare with and to build upon existing techniques, knowing that they are using exactly the same implementation.
