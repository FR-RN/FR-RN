The [Institute for Replication (I4R)](https://i4replication.org/) works to improve the credibility of science by systematically reproducing and replicating research findings in leading academic journals. Our team collaborates with researchers to:

* **Reproductions and Replications**: Promote and generate reproductions and replications. Establish an open access website to serve as a central repository containing the replications, responses by the original authors and documentation.
* **Replication Resources**: Prepare standardized file structure, code and documentation aimed at facilitating reproducibility and replicability by the broader community.
* **Teaching Resources**: Develop and provide access to educational material on replication and open science.
* **Dissemination**: Help researchers disseminate and publish reproductions and replications.
