Science Europe is organising its [first conference on Open Science](https://www.scienceeurope.org/events/open-science-conference-2022/) at an important time: the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the value of open and collaborative research, and the November 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science has invited world regions to discuss shared values, principles, and standards.

At this 18 and 19 October Open Science conference, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the current policy initiatives, research assessment reforms, and financial measures that support the transition to Open Science, and look forward at new trends.

We will also explore the impact of the transition on the daily reality of researchers, their teams, and institutions, and discuss ways to make the transition to Open Science fair and equitable.
