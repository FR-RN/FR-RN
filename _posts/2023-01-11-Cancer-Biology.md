The lack of reproducibility in life sciences research, and particularly in Cancer Biology, is a growing concern in recent years, often referred to as ‘Reproducibility Crisis’. The Center for Open Science published in 2021, in the journal eLife, the results of its ‘Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology’ reporting poor reproducibility of previously published results in the field of Cancer Research.

[In this
workshop](https://oncospheremeeting.com/workshop-on-reproducibility-in-cancer-biology/)
experts in different fields, through a transdisciplinary approach,
will discuss the causes, the implications and potential solutions for
the Reproducibility problems in Cancer Research.
