The first [Workshop on Reproducible Software Environments for Research
and High-Performance Computing
(HPC)](https://hpc.guix.info/events/2023/workshop/) will take place in
Montpellier, France, 8–10 November 2023.

The [program](https://hpc.guix.info/events/2023/workshop/program)
features talks by scientists, engineers, and system administrators from
different backgrounds who will share their experience with
[GNU Guix](https://hpc.guix.info), a tool for reproducible software
deployment.  It also includes tutorials on GitLab, Guix, and other tools
that support scientific workflows—from bioinfo analyses to HPC and
source code archival.

The workshop aims to be a hub for scientists and practitioners,
newcomers and experts.
