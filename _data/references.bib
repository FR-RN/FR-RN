  abstract =     {Understanding whole-brain-scale electrophysiological
                  recordings will rely on the collective work of multiple labs.
                  Because two labs recording from the same brain area often
                  reach different conclusions, it is critical to quantify and
                  control for features that decrease reproducibility. To address
                  these issues, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a
                  shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental
                  apparatus. We repeatedly inserted Neuropixels multi-electrode
                  probes targeting the same brain locations (including posterior
                  parietal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice performing
                  the behavioral task. We gathered data across 9 labs and
                  developed a common histological and data processing pipeline
                  to analyze the resulting large datasets. After applying
                  stringent behavioral, histological, and electrophysiological
                  quality-control criteria, we found that neuronal yield, firing
                  rates, spike amplitudes, and task-modulated neuronal activity
                  were reproducible across laboratories. To quantify variance in
                  neural activity explained by task variables (e.g., stimulus
                  onset time), behavioral variables (timing of licks/paw
                  movements), and other variables (e.g., spatial location in the
                  brain or the lab ID), we developed a multi-task neural network
                  encoding model that extends common, simpler regression
                  approaches by allowing nonlinear interactions between
                  variables. We found that within-lab random effects captured by
                  this model were comparable to between-lab random effects.
                  Taken together, these results demonstrate that across-lab
                  standardization of electrophysiological procedures can lead to
                  reproducible results across labs. Moreover, our protocols to
                  achieve reproducibility, along with our analyses to evaluate
                  it are openly accessible to the scientific community, along
                  with our extensive electrophysiological dataset with
                  corresponding behavior and open-source analysis code.Competing
