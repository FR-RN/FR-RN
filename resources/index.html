<h2 id="mailing-list">Mailing list</h2>

<p>The objective of the list <a href="https://listes.univ-orleans.fr/sympa/subscribe/recherche-reproductible">recherche-reproductible</a> is to compare the points of view of different scientific disciplines on the notion of reproducibility and to list the different initiatives taken, particularly at the national level. Beyond the diagnosis specific to each discipline, the aim is to identify certain common problems and to evoke, with different actors (researchers, scientific publishers, etc.), the solutions that can emerge around the concept of executable publication.</p>

<h2 id="discussion-forum">Discussion forum</h2>

<p><a href="https://reproducible-research.inria.fr/about">Reproducible research forum</a> is the place for discussing freely about reproducibility in order to improve our research methodology by exchanging experiences, informations and advices.
Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.
The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.</p>

<h2 id="syndication">Syndication</h2>

<p>The <a href="/FR-RN/feed.xml">RSS</a> feed provides latest news from the network and upcoming events related to reproducibility in France and worldwide.</p>

<h2 id="reproducible-research-methodological-principles-for-transparent-science">Reproducible research: methodological principles for transparent science</h2>

<p>This <strong><a href="https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/reproducible-research-methodological-principles-transparent-scie/">MOOC</a></strong> proposes methodological principles for open and transparent science. It deals in a practical way with note-taking, computational documentation, replicability of analyses. You take notes and you want to be able to find them back? You make calculations on your computer, but your results change from day to day? You analyse data, or you work on a new method that you would like to share easily with your colleagues so that they can use it as well? This MOOC is for you.</p>

<h2 id="towards-repdroducible-research">Towards repdroducible research</h2>

<p>For a researcher, there is nothing more frustrating than the failure to reproduce major results obtained a few months back. The causes of such disappointments can be multiple and insidious. This phenomenon plays an important role in the so-called “research reproducibility crisis”. This <strong><a href="https://rr-france.github.io/bookrr/">book</a></strong> takes a current perspective onto a number of potentially dangerous situations and practices, to examplify and highlight the symptoms of non-reproducibility in research. Each time, it provides efficient solutions ranging from good-practices that are easily and immediately implementable to more technical tools, all of which are free and have been put to the test by the authors themselves. With this book written during a book sprint, students and engineers and researchers should find efficient and accessible ways leading them to improve their reproducible research practices.</p>
