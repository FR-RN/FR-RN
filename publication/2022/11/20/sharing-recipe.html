<meta name="description" content="The open and transparent documentation of scientific processes has been established as a core antecedent of free knowledge. This also holds for generating robust insights in the scope of research projects. To convince academic peers and the public, the research process must be understandable and retraceable (reproducible), and repeatable (replicable) by others, precluding the inclusion of fluke findings into the canon of insights. In this contribution, we outline what reproducibility and replicability (R&amp;R) could mean in the scope of different disciplines and traditions of research and which significance R&amp;R has for generating insights in these fields. We draw on projects conducted in the scope of the Wikimedia “Open Science Fellows Program” (Fellowship Freies Wissen), an interdisciplinary, long-running funding scheme for projects contributing to open research practices. We identify twelve implemented projects from different disciplines which primarily focused on R&amp;R, and multiple additional projects also touching on R&amp;R. From these projects, we identify patterns and synthesize them into a roadmap of how research projects can achieve R&amp;R across different disciplines. We further outline the ground covered by these projects and propose ways forward." />
